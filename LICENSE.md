1. Entire Agreement; Not a Master Purchase Agreement; Agreed Definitions.
1.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement is binding on Company and Trend Micro when referenced or incorporated in a Quote from Trend Micro or a Reseller that directs Company to the website at which this Agreement is posted and Company places an Order for Products in response to such Quote that is accepted by Trend Micro by issuance of a License Certificate to Company for the Ordered Products. If no such Quote is provided to Company but nevertheless Company places an Order for Products with Trend Micro or a Reseller, the Parties agree that such Order, if accepted by Trend Micro by issuance of a License Certificate to Company for the Ordered Products, is licensed/sold on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including all policies, procedures, and websites referenced herein) and the issued License Certificate that is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Agreement for all purposes. The Parties agree that this Agreement is the final, complete, and exclusive statement of the agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and any prior written agreements; representations, statements, or advertising of Trend Micro whether oral or written; course of dealing between the Parties or usage of the trade; Orders; or descriptions that are not specifically set forth in this Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, are all merged into and superseded by this Agreement. In entering into this Agreement, each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that it is NOT relying on any extrinsic representation, warranty, covenant, promise, forbearance, or inducement of any kind or nature that is or was made by any person that is not specifically set forth in this Agreement. By downloading, installing, deploying, and/or using any Trend Micro Product obtained by Company for which a Trend Micro License Certificate is issued by Trend Micro to Company, Company ratifies and confirms its agreement to this Agreement (including the License Certificate) as the sole and exclusive terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions governing the purchase/license of such Products. Direct questions and concerns about this Agreement to: legal_notice@trendmicro.com.
1.2 Not a Master Purchase Agreement. Company acknowledges that this is NOT a master purchase agreement for subsequent purchases of Products, but rather, this Agreement only applies to each instant purchase/license of Products by Company. Each subsequent procurement/license of Products by Company will be made subject to and conditioned on the agreement of the Parties to the then-current version of this Agreement unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by the Parties.
1.3 Procurement Under This Agreement. Company may secure Products under this Agreement by one of two methods:
a. Procurement Through a Reseller. Typically, Company will secure a Quote for Products from a Reseller of Trend Micro Products. Based on such Quote, Orders by Company will be sent to the Reseller at such prices, discounts, and on invoice and payment terms as agreed solely by Company and its Reseller. Company understands that if an Order is placed with a Reseller, the Reseller can place an order with Trend Micro for Products (either directly through Trend Micro or through a Trend Micro distributor) as requested by Company, but such Order is and will be subject to acceptance or rejection by Trend Micro at its discretion. Based on documents submitted by the Reseller, Trend Micro will reject or accept the Order, which acceptance is signified by Trend Micro’s issuance of its License Certificate. Except for the matters agreed in the first sentence of this paragraph between the Reseller and Company, all other rights, obligations, terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions regarding Products that are Ordered by Company are exclusively set forth in this Agreement. All payments by Company for Products will be made directly to the Reseller and never to Trend Micro. Company acknowledges that each Reseller is an independent contractor and in no event or circumstance will any Reseller now or hereafter be deemed a joint venturer, partner, fiduciary, or agent of Trend Micro and NO Reseller has been or will be authorized or permitted to have a right to create any binding obligation, responsibility, duty, liability, warranty, guaranty, or any otherwise contract for or act on behalf of Trend Micro or waive or renounce any right of Trend Micro or modify any right, obligation, or agreement of Company set forth in this Agreement.
b. Direct Purchase from Trend Micro. Company may (if permitted by Trend Micro) secure a Quote directly from, and place an Order directly with, Trend Micro based on such Quote, which Order if accepted by Trend Micro will be governed solely by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions set forth in this Agreement (including the License Certificate). All prices and payment terms will be as set forth in the Quote and all payments for Products will be made by Company directly to Trend Micro.

The obligation of Trend Micro under this Section 13 for any IP Claim is subject to and conditioned on Company giving Trend Micro: (a) prompt written notice of any IP Claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Trend Micro to respond without prejudice to its position), provided that a failure to provide notice shall only relieve Trend Micro of its indemnity obligation to the extent Trend Micro was prejudiced by such failure; (b) sole and complete control and authority over the defense, negotiations, and settlement of such IP Claim; and (c) reasonable requested information, cooperation and assistance, at Trend Micro’s expense, with regard to the defense, negotiations, or settlement of such IP Claim.

13.3 IP Claim Mitigation. Should any Software at any time become, or in Trend Micro’s opinion be likely to become, the subject of an IP Claim, Trend Micro shall have the right, at its sole option to: (a) procure for Company the right to continue using the Software as licensed hereunder, or (b) modify the Software such that it no longer is the subject of an IP Claim, while maintaining substantially the same functionality of the unmodified Software. If neither (a) or (b) are commercially practicable in Trend Micro’s opinion, Trend Micro may terminate this Agreement as to such Software and any related license granted hereunder as to the Software upon written notice, in which event Company will cease further use of the Software and return or uninstall and irrevocably destroy all copies of the subject Software (and Documentation) and, thereafter, Trend Micro will promptly refund to Company, the prorated portion of the license fees paid by Company for the remainder of any unexpired Subscription Period for such Software(s) or, if and to the extent such Software are licensed for a Perpetual Period, Trend Micro shall refund to Company all license fees paid by Company for the affected Software as amortized on a straight line basis over a three (3) year period and any unused, prepaid annual Maintenance fees.
